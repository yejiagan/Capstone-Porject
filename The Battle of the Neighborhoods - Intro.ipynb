This means that at least 110,000 students are looking for a new home in London every year, even if domestic students from outside of London are not considered. \n\nThe low quality of the dormitories offered by schools themselves, the shortage of student housing, and the relatively good economic resources of the international students who attend schools in London offered an economic opportunity to firms such as Unite Students which have built thousands of units of student housing in London."

However, as they are in high demand, it is not easy to secure a place in one. Therefore this project aims to explore different neighborhoods of London and find the best area to build a new dormitory so that international students could solve this persistent problem and real-estate company may find potential business opportunities.\n\nFrom the student perspective, a lot of factors come into play while searching for the best accommodation, including location, safety and rent fee. However, in this project, we will only focus on the safety and the general atmosphere of the neighborhood for simplicity purpose."
